- test all readme cases with function() rather than () => to make sure they work well
- test actual use cases and document ... uploading a file using blob, downloading a file, .. all that we want implemented basically.
- document file.js
- finish save definition on what contents can be, and fix on read me when done.. (File (form)? js obj (and json parse... ugh.)? dataurl string? url?)
- load -> array of filenames, and document
- delete -> array of filenames and document ? (not really important...)
- Simple demo in a folder (not the webpack one im using...)
